# si-scrape

A ruby script for scraping information from the web portal for the collections of the Smithsonian Institution.

## How to use

(This README assumes basic knowledge of how to run a Ruby script from your command line. Basic tutorials can be found for [Windows computers](http://www.editrocket.com/articles/ruby_windows.html) and [OS X](http://www.editrocket.com/articles/ruby_mac_os_x.html))


### Generate your query URL

Establish your search parameters on the [SI collection portal](http://collections.si.edu/search/results.htm?q=). You can enter search keywords, as well as narrow your results by various parameters like "date", "culture", or "catalog record source" (helpful for limiting your search to a particular museum within the SI.) Once you have entered your terms, copy the URL from your browser's address bar. It will look something like: `http://collections.si.edu/search/results.htm?tag.cstype=all&q=space&fq=object_type:%22Works+of+art%22`

### Run the script

Run `ruby si-scrape.rb` and paste the copied URL when prompted. The script will begin to download from `collections.si.edu`, displaying a rough progress bar like this:

	$ ruby si-scrape.rb 
	Enter query URL: http://collections.si.edu/search/results.htm?tag.cstype=all&fq=object_type%3A%22Works+of+art%22
	Pages of results: 704
	|===>>                                               | 6% Results scraped

I hope to modify future versions of this script to perform this parsing as well, and output a flat CSV.
